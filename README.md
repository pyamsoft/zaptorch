## What is ZapTorch

Born out of frustration, ZapTorch is an extremely simple application which  
allows the user to turn on the device flashlight by simply double pressing  
the volume down key on the device. As long as the screen is on, the device  
flashlight will turn on in torch mode. The torch flashlight can be turned off  
using the same method of double clicking the volume down key.

The application currently supports all versions of the Camera API on  
supported devices as well as the torch callback model on Marshmallow and up  
which requires no Camera permission to run. The Lollipop (camera2) and lower  
(camera) API versions will requires the Camera permission on the device.  

## Development

ZapTorch is developed in the Open on GitHub at:
